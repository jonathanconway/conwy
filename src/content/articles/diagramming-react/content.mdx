After working on a [Typescript diagram format](/articles/diagramming-ts) I wanted to focus on a React equivalent.

Diagrams can be useful for various purposes:
- Designing a solution at a high-level before writing any code
- Understanding an existing code-base by diagramming it
- Quickly sketching ideas to compare different designs or work out a refactoring strategy

In this article I'll describe a UML-influenced diagramming format for React.

## Overview

The format consistent of the following elements:

- **Component** - rectangle with title and list of props
- **Component call** - caller to callee connected with solid-arrow-terminated line
- **Component call with props** - caller to props and props to callee connected with solid-arrow-terminated line
- **Component render props** - render prop rectangle connected to component with dot-terminated line
- **Function** - rectangle with title and list of parameters
- **Type or interface** - rectangle with title and list of props

## Component

A component is depicted with a depicted with a rectangle with `<<Component>>` descriptor and title at the top and, optionally, props underneath.

## Component call

A component can render another component – here this is referred to as a "component call".

A component call is depicted with a line from the caller component rectangle to the callee component rectangle, terminating in a filled arrow symbol.

## Component call with props

A component can pass props to another component – here this is referred to as a "component call with props".

A component call with props is depicted with a line from the caller component rectangle to a props rectangle and another line from the props rectangle to the callee component rectangle, terminating in a filled arrow symbol.

The props are depicted in a props rectangle, in which each prop has its own rectangle. This allows any individual prop to be linked to a type, function or component rectangle.

## Component render props

Render props are props for which we pass a React component, a function which renders a component or a React node.

A render prop is depicted with a line from the prop box to a Component or Function rectangle, terminating in a dot symbol.

## Function

Same as in the [Typescript diagram format](/articles/diagramming-ts), a function is depicted with a rectangle with `<<Function>>` descriptor and title at the top and, optionally, parameters underneath.

## Type or interface

Same as in the [Typescript diagram format](/articles/diagramming-ts), a type or interface is depicted with a rectangle with `<<Type>>` or `<<Interface>>` descriptor and title at the top and, optionally, fields underneath.

A **composition relationship** between types or an inheritance relationship between interfaces is depicted with a line from the composer/inheritor to the composed/inherited type/interface, terminating in an empty arrow symbol.

A **reference relationship** between two components, functions, types or interfaces is depicted with a line from the referencer to the referenced, terminating in an arrow symbol.

## Example: contacts list

Here's an example of a React diagram depicting components that make up a contacts list.

- ContactsList component
- ContactsList -> ContactListItem component call with render props
- ContactsListItem component
- ContactPhone component
- ContactEmail component
- Contact interface
- getContacts function
