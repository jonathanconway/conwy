## Motivation

Cultivating good working relationships is vital to career success and maybe even overall happiness, if current research is to believed.

Given this fact, I thought it would be good to share what I've learned and what's worked for me in this area. It's a topic that seems sorely lacking in coverage, with many developer focussed blogs and videos focussed more on technical details or how interview skills. I think interpersonal skills are just as important as technical skills, given the highly interpersonal nature of development. And maintaining good working relationships is just as important as building them, since most of us probably want to keep jobs for a while and since they can impact our happiness and well-being.

Some of this will seem like "common sense", but as the old saying goes, common sense isn't too common. I find I often have to remind myself to keep up these simple practices, since they are not always the obvious or natural course of action and since there's so much to distract from them in the modern work environment.


## List of tips

Here are my tips:

1. Know who you report to
2. Work to understand what your main report wants of you
3. Keep your main report informed in a timely manner
4. Be nice and helpful to everyone you work with
5. Build trust over time through actions
6. Find a balance between honesty and tact
7. Maintain a positive attitude no matter what
8. Present a consistent persona to your team
9. Be proactive in understanding – if you don't know, ask!

I'll go into a bit more detail on each.

## 1. Know who you report to

The most important working relationship is probably between you and your "boss", whoever that is. After all, they are likely the person who originally hired you into the role and will have a big say in determining how long you stay in the role, what your duties are and so on.

You have to be careful here, as things might not be what they seem. Most likely the organisation chart (if there is one) will indicate who you report to. But this is not necessarily the person you really report to. Also it could change over time, as people are promoted or move to different parts of the business. In addition to checking written materials such as org charts, it's probably best to "ask around" a little.

## 2. Learn what your report wants of you

Try to meet with your report one-on-one, on a semi-regular basis. I find 30-60 minutes on a a 1-2 week cadence usually works. You don't need to meet with them too often, lest they feel you're hogging their time. But take advantage of any incidental opportunities if they come up.

During one-on-ones, listen carefully and try to identify keywords and key themes. Take notes if possible (you can do this afterwards, if you think it will make them or you uncomfortable). Ask directly what they want, but also try to find indirect means to get a general feel for what's wanted. Managers are not always comfortable communicating everything they want explictly. Or they might not know what they want or might struggle to put it into words. This is why it's important to meet several times, listen carefully and diligently take notes. You need to build up thorough-as-possible mental model of what your report wants, including small but important details that could easily be overlooked.

As you get a better mental model of what your report wants, you can gradually adapt your own behaviour and priorities to better match it. By doing this, you ensure the most important working relationship – the one that keeps you in your job – works well for both you and your report!

An added benefit of "deep listening" is that it makes the other person feel appreciated and like you, which in itself helps maintain a good working relationship. 

## 3. Keep your report informed

Your report probably wants to be the first to know about any important change in your situation. They want to feel "in control" of their team dynamic. By keeping them updated promptly and regularly, you build and maintain their trust and sense of control.

I use the word "control" here for lack of a better one. It's not that managers are dictatorial. It's simply that they are often under pressure from their own managers to deliver results, so they obviously want to feel that the team they're managing are somewhat stable, reliable and able to deliver.

The more you can make your report feel at-ease that you're not going to, say, suddenly quit on them or suddenly change your work ethic, etc. the better they will trust you and the better the working relationship will be.

## 4. Be nice to everyone

It's always worthwhile to be nice, friendly and helpful at every opportunity.

People naturally reward and reciprocate those who treat them well. You never know whose help you might need. Sometimes those who seem the least capable or willing to help you end up being the ones you rely on the most. Work (and life) can be unpredictable like that.

People notice how you treat others, and often use that to draw conclusions about you. So the more positively others perceive you, the more likely the positive perception is to grow to yet others. If people generally have a positive perception of you, it's more likely that they will share knowledge with you, offer to help you when you need help and put in good words about you.

If you genuinely help your team mates, this makes them stronger, which makes your team stronger. You are better off if your team is stronger – then your team is more likely to achieve its objectives, to maintain its funding, to potentially even grow in numbers and generally to do well. This will, in turn, strengthen the team members' relationships with each-other and improve everyone's morale, peace of mind and actual job security. Deliberately improving your team's performance is an indirect but powerful way to improve your working relationships.

Treat your team like a garden: care for every aspect of it and then enjoy the fruits that result!

> Aside: Small tip: Smile a lot. Research shows that smiling makes you appear more open and friendly to others and also boosts your own mood. 

## 5. Build trust through actions

People will ultimately judge you on your actions, not your promises. So while it's good to show earnestness and ambitiousness by agreeing and committing to things publicly, it is just as important (if not more important) to follow through with actions.

Keep your actions modest so you can reliably complete them and sustain the effort over time. You don't have to be ultra productive. Just do the best job you can with the resources you have and sustain the effort repeatedly.

Persist despite small failures and set-backs. People are remarkably forgiving, as long as you show a good work ethic and determination. People will generally judge you positively on the quality and consistency of your effort, even if you don't achieve big results super fast.

You want to sustain a steady, visible "engine of effort", which your team members and report see as useful to their own goals and interests. Over time, they will trust you to be able to complete certain kinds of work, and as a result, then they then entrust work to you, which they are confident you are capable of delivering on. This trust and sharing of effort is what enables a team to effectively break down and delegate work between its members, rather than just a few or one individual "hogging" all the work themselves.

## 6. Balance honesty with tact

Honesty is important but it isn't everything.

Would a good doctor explain to his critically ill cancer patient every excruciating detail about how their bodies are breaking down, driving them into pain and despair? Definitely not! Patient care involves an element of honesty but also an element of consideration for the feelings of the patients themselves. The overall objective is the well-being of the patient: "do no harm".

Be honest when and where it really counts and will be helpful, but know when and how much to restrain yourself.

This is especially helpful when commenting on others' work, such as in code reviews. Sometimes it's better to go with a team members' idea or approach even if you have reservations about it, just to ensure a smooth and pleasant experience for that team member.

Keep in mind that your team members can be under various pressures, some which you might not even be aware of. For example, team members might not talk openly about their health conditions, family tensions, financial pressures or their own relationships with their managers. Just because you don't see, hear or know about these pressures doesn't mean they don't exist. So it's better to go out of your way to be tactful.

## 7. Maintain a positive attitude

Positivity is critical to achieving difficult goals. You have to believe you can. This is not about self-delusion, but about motivation, which is necessary for sustained effort over time.

Maintain a positive attitude.

## 8. Present a consistent persona

It's better to be as consistent and predictable as possible in your general behaviour and personality.

People like to feel "in control" of their environment, including team members such as yourself. They like to feel they can predict how you will act. The more consistent you are, the easier you are to predict. This makes you easier to work with and more likely that people will want to work with you and enjoy working with you.

Don't get hung up on small details such as what you wear or what times you book meetings. People don't notice these things as much as you think. What people really notice is how you behave toward them and others. This behaviour is the most critical thing to be consistent about.

What kinds of actions do I refer to, when I advise "consistency"?

Here are some examples:

1. Do you prefer to respond to questions by first asking clarifying questions?
2. Do you tend to be the first to show up to a meeting?
3. Do you tend to be the first to speak in a meeting?
3. Do you post updates in the team chat about what you're working on?

If the above actions, or other actions, work well for you and everyone else, why not do them consistently?

Make them habitual, modifying them only slightly and gradually if ever.

People will get used to you behaving the same way every day and will thus feel more secure in relation to you.

When you're consistent, you appear to your team members like a "tool", which they can grasp and use in various ways. This is a very powerful force for keeping your work relationships positive and keeping you in the job. When people perceive you as useful, they will want to involve you in projects and keep you on-side. So being useful to others is actually to your advantage, not your detriment!


## 9. Ask early!

There is always a lot of assumed knowledge and context. In today's complex and rushed work environments, it's tough for people to keep track of who knows what. So if you don't clarify your uncertainties and knowledge gaps, they will only grow, and this will slow down your progress and undermine your productivity.

As soon as you spot a knowledge gap on your part – either large or small – quickly seek to fill it. Even partially filling it is far better than doing nothing. Ask people, search the company wiki or chat, even do an online search. If you can't find the answer quickly, add it to a checklist of open questions, which you can gradually chip away at over time.

It's also generally a good look to ask questions. It shows curiosity, eagerness, intelligence and generally that you care about the work. This is a good look to have.

There are, of course, situations where asking a certain question doesn't look good. But these are likely few and rare in the overall scheme of things. So in general, you're probably better off asking than not asking.


## Conclusion







-----------------





Positive Psychology sees three principal causes of the demoralization
among lawyers. The first is pessimism, defined not in the colloquial sense
(seeing the glass as half empty) but rather as the pessimistic explanatory
style laid out in Chapter 6. These pessimists tend to attribute the causes of
negative events to stable and global factors (“It’s going to last forever, and
it’s going to undermine everything”). The pessimist views bad events as
pervasive, permanent, and uncontrollable, while the optimist sees them as
local, temporary, and changeable. Pessimism is maladaptive in most
endeavors: Pessimistic life insurance agents sell less and drop out sooner
than optimistic agents. Pessimistic undergraduates get lower grades,
relative to their SAT scores and past academic record, than optimistic
students. Pessimistic swimmers have more substandard times and bounce
back from poor efforts worse than do optimistic swimmers. Pessimistic
pitchers and hitters do worse in close games than optimistic pitchers and
hitters. Pessimistic NBA teams lose to the point spread more often than
optimistic teams.








Empathy, the most powerful tool of compassion, is an emotional
skill set that allows us to understand what someone is
experiencing and to reflect back that understanding. Empathy
has a huge upside. Researchers Peter Paul Zurek and Herbert
Scheithauer explain that empathy helps interpersonal decision
making; facilitates ethical decision making and moral judgments;
enhances short-term subjective well-being; strengthens relational
bonds; allows people to better understand how others see them; and
enhances prosocial and altruistic behavior.
