Over the last few years I've been making steady progress getting in better shape. It's not been a straight path, but I'm pleased to say, I've been able to get very close to my ideal body type several times, and am much closer now than I was even a few months ago!

> Aside: Caveat: I don't pretend to be any kind of authority on this. This article will just be a catalog of ideas I collected from various sources (some evidence-based, some experience-based) which seem to have worked for me.

## Goal

Before launching into the tactics, I want to clarify my goal. I actually didn't start out with this goal, so the goal itself has also been refined quite a few times.

My basic goal is a lean-muscular, moderately "athletic" body.

There are some constraints around this goal:

- **Long-term.** Not just for a few months. Ideally lifelong.
- **Healthy.** Not involving toxic chemicals or unhealthy extremes.
- **Frugal.** That is, spending little or no more than I would otherwise.
- **International.** I should be able to move to another location without losing momentum.
- **Environmentally conscious.** At least not adding more damage to the natural world than I would otherwise.

As you can imagine, adding these constraints necessarily adds some complexity. However I found it's all quite doable, with some ingenuity and, most importantly, persistance!

## Motivation

It's important to always have what we call a "north star", "apex goal", etc. One of Schwarzenegger’s most famous quotes is: “Visualize your success".

Some thoughts that keep me going:
- Achieving something difficult that even some great or famous people would struggle with
- That "light as a feather" and energised feeling throughout the day, carrying less weight around
- Looking good, having an look that is pleasant, to myself and maybe others
- Being as physically fit as possible into my 70s, regardless of what happens to me, health or otherwise
- Avoiding health issues associated with obesity and lack of fitness, such as cardiovascular and cancer

These all congeal into an image in my mind of successful, active, mature fitness.

Some figures who I think about for motivation:
- [Lee Bowman](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/wentworth-courier/more-than-50-clubbies-turned-up-at-the-hospital-to-farewell-lee-bowman-before-he-died/news-story/ea354b84d1aea68eedfcf4b7dd74818a), a famous Sydney-sider and two-pound-pom who maintained 6-pack abs well into his 60s.
- [Mark Sisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sisson), a famous athlete and blogger who stays in shape in his 70s.
- [Lord Kentigern](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55213429-her-bridegroom-bought-and-paid-for), a fictional character from a rather underrated womens romance novel by Alice Coldbreath. (I'm not joking.)

When all else fails, I just imagine having ripped abs while partying on a yacht in Fiji. That usually does it!

## Monitoring

Any long-term endeavour should have appropriate monitoring.

I've given up on measuring body weight or mucking around with measuring tape.

***A quick look in the mirror on a regular basis seems the surest measure!***

And the best way to avoid making excuses.

## Routine

> “We are what we repeatedly do. ... Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.”

> – ARISTOTLE

> “Don't Make Me Think”
>
> – Steven KRUG

What has helped me the most is simply **having a daily routine**. Having a consistent, repeatable layout to my day ensures that I keep acting toward my goal.

My routine has functioned as a kind of "fall back" which I can execute almost mindlessly, without stressing and lapsing. It's a **simple default** that enables me to accomplish my tasks as easily and directly as possible, without hesitation or doubt.

This has actually been good for my mental health too. I'm less anxious when I don't have to constantly worry about what to do next. Of course, I do change my routine, but I do it in a relaxed, contemplative frame of mind, not in the heat of the moment.

I've been able to maintain my routine pretty consistently throughout international travel, changing work hours and various ups and downs of life.

One trick is to make the routine flexible and focus primarily on activities, rather than timing. So if I miss a morning workout, it's Ok, I just need to do that workout in the evening instead. So the *times* are flexible, while the *activities* remain solid.

## Exercise

Exercise is a critical part of my routine. It builds and maintains muscle tone and sustains health (including mental) and energy levels.

All the exercises I'm about to list are:
- Reasonably environmentally friendly do not by nature involve any damage to the environment
- Can be done practically anywhere at any time of day
- Are healthy and low impact on your body, unlikely to cause serious injuries when done long term, assuming they're done with reasonable care

### Strength training

Here's a list of the specific strength exercises I do. I like to do body weight exercises, also known as calisthenics. These include:

- Pull-ups and muscle-ups on the bar. Forward and reverse grip. Several sets, each as much as I can while keeping form.
- Push-ups. Lateral and tilted up or down. On the bars or the floor.
- Dips. On the bar or between two chairs.
- Ab crunches. While resting on the bar or hanging off the bar, or lying on the floor with a weight.
- Step-ups onto a low bar, large stair step, rock, or even bedside.
- Military presses with weight or resistance band.
- Bicep curls with with weight or resistance band.

In case you didn't notice, many of these can be done either with or without the gym! I can just use body weight, furniture or outdoor facilities. This makes the exercise routine easy to maintain throughout travelling or unexpected changes in the my day.

These exercises build and maintain muscle safely and consistently.

Muscle aids weight loss in multiple ways:
- Increases metabolism
- Improves stamina for cardio
- Good for general health - heart, lungs, etc.

### HIIT

I've recently adopted high-intensity interval training. Here I do body-weight cardio exercises at a high intensity, with 20 second breaks, for a period of 5-10 minutes.

HIIT seems to generally accelerate my progress and I've seen plenty of studies showing its benefit for overall health.

The real beauty of HIIT is its simplicity and minimalism. I don't even need equipment. All I need is floor-space and discipline! This makes it easy to maintain during travel or changes to my day plan.

My HIIT routine varies, but typically consists of:
- Burpees
- Squat-jumps
- Star-jumps
- Push-ups
- Back squeeze while lying on chest
- Jogging on the spot

I found HIIT is the toughest exercise to begin, yet the easiest to complete once started. Funny that!

### Swimming

I like to do laps at the local pool. Ok maybe that's not 100% on the environmental scale, but I can (and maybe eventually will) switch to ocean or lake swimming. Swimming is great all-round cardio workout and very safe and low-impact.

### Walking

Yes, simply walking.

The real beauty of walking, apart from being minimal and easy to take anywhere on travels, is how it can be combined with other activities. I can get pretty zoned in to a fantastic array of audio material – great [audiobooks](/reading), podcasts, online courses and symphonies.

I can also combine it with travelling to appointments, shopping, remote meetings, bushwalking and just general exploration of the world. 🙂

### Standing

I've been trying to stand more during the day. Studies have shown that increasing standing time is positive for overall fitness and burns more calories. Most modern offices have standing desks. At home it's easy to turn almost any surface into a standing desk simply using a sturdy cardbord box or crate or two.

### Managing pain

There's been some occasional pain involved in exertion. Feeling fatigued, occasional muscle aches, occasional heel spur.

I don't have any one sure answer to this, but more like a set of small "mind hacks" that help me to manage pain and stay the course.

- **Exercise even when I don’t want to.** *Especially* when I don't want to, so as to reinforce the habit.
- **Meditation, mindful breathing.** Deep inhalations, breathing into the pain, being with my body.
- **Effort-reward cycle.** Making the effort with the knowledge that I'll feel better at the end. (And yes, 99% of the time I do feel better!)
- **Awareness of body.** Especially the effect of heat/cold, caffeine, sleep. When drowsy or lethargic, I remind myself of external factors to avoid excusing myself from putting in work.

### Enjoying the weather

I've found weather isn't usually a reason not to exercise. Actually, with the right mindset, I find the weather more of an incentive.

When it's hot and sunny, I enjoy the intensity of the sunshine. When its cold and wet, I enjoy the calming effect of the coolness and rain. When it's humid and cloudy... well... I tell myself to toughen up! 😄 Recalling stoic quotes can help.

Suitable clothing really helps here. When it's hot, I wear minimal clothes, light materials and forms that free up my body, like shorts and singlets. When it's cooler, I wear clothes that conserve heat while keeping my body flexible, like close-fitting long-sleeve wool shirts and tight pants.

## Diet

I've settled on the [mediterranean diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet) as my diet of choice. This diet is plant-based, mostly fruit, vegetables and whole grains; with some added fish, dairy; and plant-based fats like olive oil. It's high in nutrients, filling, low-calorie and I find it delightful!

Environmentally it's maybe a little less good that pure veganism/vegetarianism, due to the fish and dairy content. I am investigating more sustainable options such as synthetic fish and dairy alternatives.

### Meals

Meals I prepare regularly with minimal fuss:

- **Fruit.** In-season berries or citrus fruits. Combined with a cup of plain or sugar-free flavoured yogurt. This combo I find especially refreshing in hot weather and/or just after an intense workout.
- **Sardines.** From a tin. Fried or fresh. Seasoned with lemon/lime juice or vinegar and topped with ground pepper. Side of wholemeal pasta or a bread roll. Maybe complimented with tomato sauce (simply onions fried in tomato paste and vinegar) and/or a quarter of avocado.
- **Veggies.** Steamed in a pot. Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, brussels sprouts, etc. With some added carrot, capsicum, red onions, button mushrooms or whatever else I feel like. Sprinkled with vinegar, a single stick of cheddar cheese cubed and generous herbs and spices, including hot chilli powder. And a carefully measured tablespoon of olive oil.
- **Oatmeal.** One half-cup of oats mixed with a teaspoon of cocoa in a small bowl. Soaked in water for a few minutes - hot or cold. Cooked for a few minutes if I have a microwave. Topped with a tablespoon of peanut butter, 5 small pieces of dried fruit and some cinnamon powder. The dried fruit adds a perfect level of sweetness and chewiness with minimal calories and practically zero sugar spike. Makes a great dessert!
- **Drinks.** I only drink water and plain coffee or tea (no sugar or milk, always before 3 PM).

> #### Aside: Note on toppings
> I like to use oils/fats as toppings rather than cooking with them. This means I can use less of them while enjoying virtually the same taste. This way I can control the calorie content. For example, I can just measure out one simple tablespoon of olive oil per day as a topping for the veggies, rather than spraying olive oil into a pan adding an uncontrollable amount of calories.

These foods/ingredients are generally cheap, available, healthy and reasonably environmentally friendly.

- **Cost:** Mostly cheap and can be purchased in bulk or found in aisles. The fresh fruit and veggies can be purchased frozen to save cost and studies show that in frozen form they are just as nutritious as refrigerated, and possibly even more nutritious!
- **Availability:** Thanks to the wonders of modern globalised trade, I've found most of these are available in most major cities and metro areas in much of the developed world. I do donate to food banks and other initiatives, with the hope that we will eliminate hunger and malnourishment for all people.
- **Health:** Nutritious, low GI, low sugar, high-fibre, high in anti-oxidants, low-calorie.
- **Environment:** There's no beef or chicken and the dairy portions are modest. Even the seafood is relatively good - consuming bottom-feeders like sardines has a lower environmental impact.

### Portion control

Importantly, I control and measure all the ingredients out. This gives me pretty much total control over calories.

I don't use any tricky or sophisticated equipment, just simple measuring rules, such as the following:
- Handfulls (pasta)
- Punnet (berries)
- Pot (yogurt)
- Can (fish)
- Piece (citrus fruit, bread roll, dried fruit)
- Quarter (avocado, potato)
- Measuring cup scoop (oats)
- Tablespoon (olive oil, lemon/lime juice, peanut butter)

Where this strict measurement really shines is **combined with routine**. I find my cooking and eating routine is especially strong when combined with other routines, especially [exercise](#exercise) and [meditation](/articles/mindfulness). Relapses are pretty rare these days.

After some time following this diet, I don't have to think much about it. I can simply rely on "force of habit" when preparing and consuming meals. The "force of habit" overrides and overwhelms any urge to cheat and eat too much or too little. This consistency has helped me overcome temptation to overeat or undereat. It took some time to build up the habit and I've had occasional relapses, but overall I've maintaing it more often than not.

### Enjoying food

I try to eat a bit slower and more mindfully. Famous spiritualist Thich Naht Hanh wrote a whole book on this topic: [How to Eat](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/545835/how-to-eat-by-thich-nhat-hanh/), which I've started reading. Some studies show that if we take 20 minutes or more to finish a meal, we'll feel satisfied.

I like to eat while involved in something relaxing and social or moderately stimulating. Typically while in an online meetup, interacting in an online chat or forum, with friends and family, and/or combined with watching or listening to something relaxing but mentally stimulating, such as history or nature documentary.

One thing I noticed since childhood is that the layout of the food can really make eating an absolute joy! For example, I like to add small "sides" that really pack a flavour of spice punch. I can then combine them with other parts of the plate as/when I want. I noticed this kind of "mix-and-match" mode of eating is prominent in the more traditional world cuisines.

- South Indian cuisine - thali
- Vietnamese cuisine - spring roles
- Spanish cuisine - tapas
- Cuban cuisine

So with my regular diet, I take inspiration from this technique of having small side portions, but adapt it to my own calorie control and nutrient constraints.

### Fasting

I like to do most of my exercise in the morning or afternoon, when I'm feeling lightest and most alert. So I generally fast most of the day (except for coffee and a small post-workout snack) and do my main eating in the early to late evening. This is known as the ["warrior diet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting).

This is a simple repeatable eating schedule, since there's only one main period of cooking/heating and only one place in which to eat. It's also very satisfying and filling to consume 2,000 calories in a 4-hour period. I'm never hungry at the end of it, as long as I finished it all and drank enough water. And I don't get hungry much during the day either, since I'm pre-occupied with work, exercise and whatever else I'm doing.

### Avoiding temptation

Whenever I'm feeling some random unexpected hunger pang (which is pretty rare these days, thanks to the routines described in this article) I try to run through a mental checklist and this usually sorts me out.

- **Am I feeling stressed?** Maybe I need a brief meditation or even just a few minutes of simple box-breathing. This is usually not a problem while out, at work or elsewhere. In the evenings, I like to use cosy soft lights to create the famous Scandinavian [Hygge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge) effect. Even on travel this can be done quite effectively with a portable USB lamp and/or tweaking my laptop display configuration.
- **Am I uncomfortable?** Maybe I just need to put on a coat or jacket, turn on the air conditioning briefly or go to the toilet.
- **Am I hydrated?** Thirst and hunger can be easily confused. I always carry a water bottle with me so I can hydrate regularly.
- **Am I tired?** This is more tricky during the day, but in the evening I can always usually go to bed earlier if I need a bit more sleep.

I've found that 9/10 times, it's not that I'm genuinely hungry, but that I'm using food as a distraction to cope with some other issue. If I can quickly find the root-cause and address it, I have no need of food.

Humans need to eat, but we don't need much, and certainly not as much as is pushed on us by the capitalist/consumerist system. If we feel hungry outside of mealtimes, it's likely something else and not a genuine need for food.

There are still a few simple, cheap, easy fallbacks if I really desperately need to eat outside my usual mealtime.

- **Mint tea.** This provides a pleasant long-lasting freshness, with zero calories or caffeine.
- **Small piece of fruit.** Usually 20-50 calories is pretty negligible and I eat it slowly to enjoy it. Great while on-the-go.
- **Pickled veggies.** Especially cucumber and carrot. Pretty low-calorie and healthy to boot!
- **Brushing my teeth again.** I don't go nuts with this, but if I want to freshen up during the day, this is healthy zero-calorie way.

### Supplements

I'm not very big on supplements, due to the cost, complexity and dubious health benefits. I take one vitamin D tablet per day if I'm not getting out in the sun much.

## Conclusion

I hope you found some utility and/or inspiration in this article!

Maintaining fitness and health is best treated as a long-term game in my opinion. The changes should be gradual, cumulative and sustainable.

In my experience, the surest way to lose unwanted fat is to maintain a calorie deficit over a long period of time by exercising vigorously on a daily basis and sticking to a healthy and enjoyable eating routine.

Optimising my exercise and diet has been a fun and fascinating (though sometimes challenging) journey. I see it as a kind of [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game), something I can always get better/smarter at and that enriches my life.
