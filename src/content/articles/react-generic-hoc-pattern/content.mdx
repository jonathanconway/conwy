I've recently developed a pattern that allows me to compose two React components together in a highly decoupled way, using a generic HOC creator.

In this article I'll motivate and outline the pattern, provide an example, and discuss my own implementation, `createWithHOC`.

## Motivation

Suppose we have an extremely ***general*** component, which we want to widely re-use by connecting it to other components in our component library.

![Diagram depicting generic and connected components](/images/articles/react-generic-hoc-pattern/generic-reused-component.png)

This component is so general that it need know hardly anything about its connected components and, vice-versa, they need hardly know anything about it.

However we do want to let the ***consumers*** of this general component easily customize its behavior through props, so that it will be maximally useful.

## Pattern

The pattern here is to create a HOC (Higher-Order Component) creator function, which can be applied to the ***general*** component by the ***combined*** components and exported for re-use by the ***consumer*** components.

1. The HOC creator function is called and passed the general component as a parameter, along with a string descriptor (more on that later).
2. Its result is a HOC, which is exported. This exported HOC allows the general component to be combined with another component.
3. One or more other components call this HOC, to combine themselves with the general component.
4. Its result is a component which has almost identical props as the combined component, except that it includes one additional prop. This additional prop, named by the string descriptor from step 1, contains the props to be passed to the general component.

## Example

Let's look at a realistic example to see how this pattern can be applied.

Suppose we have a `Tooltip` component, which takes a `children` prop and a `contents` prop. The `children` prop will have the component that triggers the tooltip. The `contents` prop will have the component that should be shown inside the tooltip.

```typescript
interface TooltipProps {
  readonly children: ReactNode;
  readonly contents: ReactNode;
}

export function Tooltip(props: TooltipProps) {
  // ...
}
```

Now in our component library, there are several different components that might all need to have a tooltip.

For example:
- Button
- Checkbox
- Image

For each of the above three components, we want to allow their consumers to provide an optional tooltip. But we don't want to couple these three components too closely to the Tooltip component. And we want the re-use of the Tooltip component to be as easy and straight-forward as possible.

First, in our `tooltip.tsx` file, lets create and export an HOC that exposes `Tooltip` in a re-usable manner:

```typescript
export const withTooltip = createWithHOC(Tooltip, "tooltip");
```

Notice that `createWithHOC` doesn't know much about `Tooltip`. It just receives its definition and a string descriptor - "tooltip". However, what it returns - `withTooltip` - is very useful.

Here's a simple implementation of our `Button` component:

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  readonly children?: ReactNode;
  readonly onClick: VoidFunction;
}

export const Button_ = (props) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
};

export const Button = withTooltip(Button_);
```

If we were to consume `Button` directly, without the `withTooltip` wrapper, it would have the `children` and `onClick` props, as we would expect.

However, with the `withTooltip` wrapper call, `Button` is now augmented with an additional `tooltip` prop. (Named by the string "tooltip", which we originally passed to the `createWithHOC` call in our `tooltip.tsx` file).

So now the props of `Button_` look like this, from a consumer's point of view:

```typescript
// Note: Fictitious interface name.
// This is just the un-named type of the props parameter of the
// `Button` component exported in the previous code sample.
interface ButtonProps { 
  readonly children?: ReactNode;
  readonly onClick: VoidFunction;
  readonly tooltip?: TooltipProps;
}
```

So when we consume `Button`, our code can look like this:

```tsx
const Item = () => {
  return (
    <Button
      onClick={handleDeleteClick}        // <-- <Button_> props
      tooltip={{ contents: "Delete" }}   // <-- <Tooltip> props
    >
      üóëÔ∏è
    </Button>
  )
}
```

This will have the same net effect as if we had consumed `Button_` directly, wrapped in `Tooltip`, passing the appropriate props to each.

```tsx
const Item = () => {
  return (
    <Tooltip contents="Delete">
      <Button_ onClick={handleDeleteClick}>
        üóëÔ∏è
      </Button_> 
    </Tooltip>
  )
}
```

## Advantages

I found three advantages of using this pattern, where applicable:

- Smaller consumer code
- Aesthetically pleasing consumer code
- Ability to constrain re-use of general components

### Smaller consumer code

Consumer code is significantly smaller and less indented, as we are relying on props rather than nesting. This benefit can add up quickly when, say, rendering multiple instances of the same component type side-by-side.

Here's an example of multiple buttons with tooltips:

```tsx
const Item = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={handleDeleteClick} tooltip={{ contents: "Delete" }}>
        üóëÔ∏è
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={handleEditClick} tooltip={{ contents: "Edit" }}>
        üìù
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={handleCopyClick} tooltip={{ contents: "Copy" }}>
        üìë
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Aesthetically pleasing consumer code

Consumer code is also more aesthetically pleasing, when relying on props. It presents as a cleaner, more compact and concise list of components.

Here's an example, in which we render different kinds of form controls side-by-side.

Using the generic HOC pattern, each form control is passed a prop to configure one or more of:
- A label
- A default
- Validation logic

```tsx
const Item = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        name="firstName"
        label={{ contents: "First name" }}
        validation={{ required: true }}
      />
      <TextInput
        name="lastName"
        validation={{ required: true }}
      />
      <DateInput
        name="dob"
        label={{ contents: "Date of birth" }}
        validation={{ required: true, maxDate: nowMinus18Years }}
        default={{ value: nowMinus20Years }}
      />
      <Checkbox
        name="registerForUpdates"
        label={{ contents: "Register for updates" }}
      />

      <Button type="Submit">
        Submit
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

All controls appear at a consistent level of indentation and so do their props. This is easier to read and more aesthetically pleasing than if each control was nested in a different set of containers (validation, etc) and appeared at inconsistent levels of indentation.

> Aside: This could be viewed as a variant of the principle of "cleaning up irregularity", discussed in Dustin Boswell's book [_The Art of Readable Code_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781449318482/), under Aesthetics (Chapter 4, pp. 37).
> The code follows a regular pattern, making it easier to visually scan and add/remove similar items (in our example, form controls).

### Ability to constrain re-use of general components

An additional advantage of this pattern is that we could, if desired, constrain the re-use of our general component.

For example, we could keep the `Tooltip` itself private to its module folder and only export the `withTooltip` HOC. Then we could only apply `withTooltip` to components that we are confident will work well with the `Tooltip`.

As a consumer, it would be easy to determine whether a given component supports the tooltip or not ‚Äì we could simply examine the available pops via our IDE's ***auto-suggest*** feature.

Here's an example with Visual Studio Code IntelliSense:

![IntelliSense suggesting the `tooltip` prop on an `IconButton` component in the conwy.co code-base](/images/articles/react-generic-hoc-pattern/vs-code-intellisense-example.png)

## Implementation

Here's the `createWithHOC` function I developed in Typescript for creating the `with*` HOC creator.

```tsx
import { get, omit } from "lodash";
import { ComponentType } from "react";

export function createWithHOC<THOCProps, THOCName extends string>(
  HOC: ComponentType<THOCProps>,
  hocName: THOCName,
) {
  return function withHOC<TLOCProps extends JSX.IntrinsicAttributes>(
    LOC: ComponentType<TLOCProps>,
  ) {
    return function ComponentWithLOC(
      props: TLOCProps & Partial<Record<THOCName, THOCProps>>,
    ) {
      const hocProps = props[hocName] as THOCProps;
      if (hocProps) {
        const hocPropsWithoutKey = omit(hocProps, "key") as THOCProps;
        const hocKey = String(get(hocProps, "key"));
        const locPropsWithoutHocProps = omit(props, hocName) as TLOCProps;
        return (
          <HOC {...hocPropsWithoutKey} key={hocKey}>
            <LOC {...locPropsWithoutHocProps} />
          </HOC>
        );
      } else {
        return <LOC {...props} />;
      }
    };
  };
}
```

I also published it as a Github Gist: [create-with-hoc.ts](https://gist.github.com/jonathanconway/8a4144df3304505f720429e464641a4a).
