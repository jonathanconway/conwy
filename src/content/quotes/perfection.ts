  text: `If one has achieved a goal to the fullest extent possible in a given context then the achievement is perfect in the rational sense of the term.
Subsequent improvements based on a wider range of knowledge or higher level of ability will not invalidate that achievement or subtract from its value. It remains perfect by the standards of the earlier context. Just as new knowledge cannot invalidate old knowledge, new achievements do not invalidate the old. Just as in epistemology, certainty is contextual, so in the realm of values, perfection is contextual.
Further, one may distinguish between one’s personal standards of perfection and the standards defining the best possible to man as such. This is not subjectivism. One’s standard of perfectly achieving a  given goal must be consistent with the facts of one’s particular abilities, interests, knowledge and hierarchy of values.`,
