TailwindJS is a Javascript/Typescript library that exposes [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) classes as Javascript objects.


TailwindJS exposes:

- **All TailwindCSS utilities** as simple constants, e.g. `h_10` => `h-10`
- **All TailwindCSS modifiers** as functions, e.g. `dark(bg_stone_900)` => `dark:bg-stone-900`

Additionally TailwindJS provides:

- **Arbitraries** - e.g. `h_arb("30rem")`
- **Helpers** - e.g. negative values (`neg`), class name joiner (`classNames`).
