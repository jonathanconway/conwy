- Rebuilt my website (previously built in Eleventy) in NextJS over a period of ~3 months.
- NextJS static site (`output: "export"`) 
- Custom builders (using NodeJS scripts) for:
  - RSS feed
  - AI summaries (using Transformers.js with bart-large-cnn)
  - Vanilla Extract class names file
  - MermaidJS diagrams in local SVG files
- Mdx format for posts (articles, micros), work, projects and content fragments
- Vanilla Extract for most styling. Colour, text and other values derived from TailwindJS
- Sticky table of contents nav for articles (custom-built)
