Braggart is an achievement tracking tool.

You can use it as a developer to keep track of important metrics. For example:

- Number of pull requests
- Number of code review comments
- Number of improvement initiatives

These metrics can be collected into reports with graphs or exported as CSV for use elsewhere.

By tracking and measuring your work you can monitor and improve your performance, increase your likelihood of promotion or market yourself to a new employer or client.
