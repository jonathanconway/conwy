Wouldn't it be nice if there was a consistent markup standard for code comments in HTML?

Some scenarios where rigorous code comments could be useful:

- Non-intuitive or hackish usage of HTML tags, elements and attributes, where explanation would help
- Other uses of non-visual elements
- Accessibility features
- Search engine optimisation (SEO) features
- Introducing HTMLDoc - a simple markup language for augmenting HTML tags and attributes with descriptive comments, which can be used to generate structured documentation.
