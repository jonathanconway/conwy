Code selectors aim to provide a consistent and concise language allowing you to reference any structure in any code file.

With code selectors, you can now write something like: `myfile.ts/login` to reference your login function or `myfile.ts/colors.r` to reference the **r** field in your **color** constant.

It's like CSS selectors, but for code!
