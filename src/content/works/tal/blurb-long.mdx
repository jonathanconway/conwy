- Customized/tweaked **EthIL**, an insurance quoting application used by sales staff.
- Fixed high priority user interface defects in .NET/WinForms-based quoting software.
- Wrote SQL migration scripts and stored procedures to make data changes to change all brand names throughout the system from "InsuranceLine" to "TAL".
