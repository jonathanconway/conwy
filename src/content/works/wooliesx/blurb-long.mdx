- Hired to plan and build from scratch **Rubix** â€“ a Web-based UI platform for applications used by Woolworths staff.
- Built a library of core controls and services, along with authentication, testing and deployment infrastructure.
- Rubix and its first application, OTA Tracker, were released to production within the first six months.
- Moved the entire codebase to an Nx-based mono-repo and SingleSPA-based micro-frontend with minimal disruption. Optimised CI build+test time down to < 5 minutes per app.
- Multiple teams built on the Rubix platform and Rubix now runs 6 apps, with 16 developers across 3 teams.
