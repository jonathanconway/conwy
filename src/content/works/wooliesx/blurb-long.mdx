Hired to plan and build from scratch **Rubix** – a Web-based logistics platform hosting various applications used by Woolworths delivery workers and contractors.

## Rubix 

- Rubix and its first application, OTA Tracker, were released to production within the first six months.
- Built a library of core controls and services, with testing and deployment infrastructure.
- Used Figma to single-handedly design early prototypes of Rubix.
- Set up Nx-based mono-repo and SingleSPA-based micro-frontend.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines, hosting setup and DNS routing in Azure.
- Integrated with Woolworths Active Directory for authorization using Keycloak Angular adapter.
- Migrated team to new mono-repo with minimal disruption.
- Optimised CI build+test time down to < 5 minutes per app.
- Multiple teams built on the Rubix platform and Rubix runs 6 apps, with 16 developers across 3 teams.

## On-Time Arrival Tracker (OTA) app

- Used Web Workers, sparse array pattern and Angular CDK virtualised scrolling for fast, efficient scrolling over massive realtime driver data.
- Prototyped iOS version of the app in Swift/SwiftUI.

## Street Service Time app

- Built a geographic polygon tool for recording service times at a street level (using LeafletJS and integrating OpenStreetMap and other providers).
- Performed comparison of mapping services to find optimal combinations of price and capability and presented findings to senior stakeholders.

## Front End Chapter

- Provided mentorship and leadership within the WooliesX Front End Chapter
- Prototyped enhanced search component using neutral nets (using BrainJS)
- Prototypes component-level automated visual regression diff testing (using Playwright)
