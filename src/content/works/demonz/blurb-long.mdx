Full-stack development of CRC – a tablet web app for municipal waste disposal tracking and financial modelling for NSW EPA.

- Used by workers on-site for rapid entry of containers, waste types, quantities, pick-ups, drop-offs, movement between waste sites and costs associated with the above.
- Separate financial reporting screens used by head-office staff with fine-grained filtering by date-time ranges, sites, locations, government districts. Export to CSV and Excel (formatted).
- Worked iteratively with stakeholders to understand nuanced and complex financial reporting requirements.
- Sketched, wireframed and mocked-up interface designs in Axure RP. Optimised for high-visibility and hand-held tablet usage, with drag-swipe interactions, large touch radius and high-contrast colours. 
- Applied BreezeJS for offline concurrency under poor/unreliable network conditions. 
- Responsible for full-stack development, deployment and production support.
