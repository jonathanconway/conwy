Implemented the core of amaysim’s new Serverless/SPA architecture, enabling them to begin transitioning the entire organisation to cloud and Serverless technology. This involved working with one other developer to build an application, then abstracting it to a “bootstrap” that could be used by other teams, to build other applications.

- **MyDevices** – a fast, reliable single-page app for managing devices and phone plans.
- **Devices API** – the micro-service powering MyDevices, built with Serverless.
- Serverless bootstrap – a user interface and server-side foundation, used by any team at amaysim to build and deploy a complete application.
- Initiated and documented amaysim’s open-source policy and guide-lines.
