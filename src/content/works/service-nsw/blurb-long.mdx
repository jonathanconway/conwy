Delivered first release of MyServiceNSW on a tight deadline. Subsequently took a leadership role, working with design, infrastructure and service providers to resolve issues and drive consistent approaches. Built many of the screens and components.

- **MyServiceNSW** – screens for login, multi-factor authentication, profile creation, connectivity to services and account/profile management.
- **Check Demerit Points** – wizard-style interface.
- **Renew Vehicle Registration** – wizard-style interface with payment integration.
- **View Vehicle History** – wizard-style interface.
- **National Parks Pass** – branching wizard-style interface with forms and validation.

Introduced innovations such as:

- Customization of Charles Proxy, enabling developers to work against a real Salesforce API, while using locally-generated assets.
- Component library for rapidly testing and demoing new components independent of Salesforce deployment pipeline, helping us increase iteration speed.
