Led a team of 5-6 web developers (within a group of 40) on the “Web Transformation” project – a rebuild of Bupa’s online presence. A working release of bupa.com.au was delivered in November 2010.

- Developed a front-end architecture based on “templates” and “components”, which enabled front-end developers and UX/designers to communicate better.
- Developed a workflow to make it easier for to integrate HTML/CSS with Vignette, by taking “snapshots” of Vignette pages and working with them locally, using a ‘base’ tag.
- Improved the web development process by implementing continuous integration (using TeamCity) and distributed versioning (using Mercurial). This resulted in faster feature delivery, and allowed for fine-grained release management.
- Improved page loading times by up to several seconds, by implementing a more efficient module pattern in the Javascript, which avoids function-call overhead.
- Took on a secondary role as release manager, coordinating deployment and testing between 9 developers and 4 testers.
- Sourced experienced candidates, conducted interviews and wrote technical tests.
