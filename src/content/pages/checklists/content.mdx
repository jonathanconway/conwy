# General

## Version control

- [ ] Rebase on master if necessary, and do this regularly if the branch is long lived
- [ ] Group related changes into one PR but split if PR gets too big

## Approach

- [ ] Legacy vs new - Agree with devs (in writing if possible) whether code written in some legacy style should be upgraded or left as-is
- [ ] Don't build features not explicitly in the requirements (though there's some strategy here; sometimes you want to, if you have a personal and clearly defined reason for it)

## Pull request

- [ ] Include readily viewable links to task and other relevant info

# Front End

## 1. Branching/Merging

- [ ] 1.1. Rebase on main branch if not done recently in case new changes are picked up that can break the build (this can happen even if there are no build conflicts)
- [ ] 1.2. Use new "best practice" approach vs. "fit in with existing code" approach based on agreement with the team
- [ ] 1.3. Group related items into the same PR rather than have many repetitive PRs

## 2. Forms

- [ ] 2.1. Disable buttons while in loading / saving state (use a11y attrs appropriately)
- [ ] 2.2. Group related controls
- [ ] 2.3. Careful not to let initialValues (or equivalent) be wiped when thereâ€™s a periodic data refresh in the query / data-source, the user might suddenly have their data cleared for no apparent reason 

## 3. Libraries

- [ ] Minimise use of feature flags, and try to remove as soon as possible
- [ ] Prefer newer libraries

## 4. Visual design / Styling

- [ ] Does it work in dark mode?
- [ ] Contrast - accessibility - do important features have 4.5:1 (regular text, AA) and 3:1 (large text; AA)? https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
- [ ] Apply white-space: pre-wrap to rendered JSON
- [ ] Is string too long? Shorten with ellipsis

## CSS

- [ ] Use rem or s-units (for React prop-based) instead of px; use other units where appropriate: vh/vw, etc.
- [ ] Meaningful ordering, e.g.:
	- [ ] 1 - Visibility (`display: none`, `visibility`, `opacity`)
	- [ ] 2 - Positioning (`position`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `z-index`, ...)
	- [ ] 3 - Size (`width`, `height`, `flex`, ...)
	- [ ] 4 - Internal Layout (`display`, `flex-*`, `margin`, `padding`, ...)
	- [ ] 5 - Borders, Backgrounds, Shadows (`border`, `background`, ...)
	- [ ] 6 - Colors, Fonts, Foregrounds (`color`, `font`, `text-*`, `line-height`, ...)
	- [ ] 7 - Interactivity (`cursor`)
- [ ] Use optimal icon format - SVG vs. font-icons vs. emojis etc


## 5. HTML

- [ ] &lt;Text&gt; should have use prop (for React prop-based)
- [ ] 

## 6. Coding style

- [ ] 6.1. Condense complex nested structures using produce or _.set
- [ ] 6.2. Avoid deeply nested if/switch structures; simplify logic, flatten conditionals or extract to functions
- [ ] 6.3. Remove unused code
- [ ] 6.4. Order component structures - constants, hook calls, event handlers, util functions then component code [React]
- [ ] 6.5. Enum values should match keys
- [ ] 6.6. Pass whole object rather than just one field if possible
- [ ] Prefer param objects to multiple params where possible
- [ ] 6.7. Clean up / flatten objects to avoid unnecessary nesting
- [ ] 6.8. Avoid using is with . filter(Boolean) ; instead, cast whole array to the expected non-null type
- [ ] Don't use non-sensible fallbacks, e.g. 27 0; just make it undefined
- [ ] If there are too many as 's / aliases in imports, import * instead and use dot-notation
- [ ] Use convenience types if available and in-use; e.g. Maybe&lt;T&gt; instead of T | undefined
- [ ] Use convenience hooks if available and in-use; e.g. useBoolean instead of useState&lt;boolean&gt;
- [ ] Maybe look for opportunities to destructure in parameter itself rather than subsequent variable
- [ ] Get rid of ? and ! suffixes where possible
- [ ] Check chains of accessors, e.g. foo.bar.baz; make sure nothing is null/undefined; add ?. if needed
- [ ] Avoid casting unless it makes sense semantically
- [ ] Remove fallbacks where possible (e.g. x??")
- [ ] Size values can be plain integers, they're half what rem would be
- [ ] Avoid single-letter lambda parameters
- [ ] Use shorter absolute import paths where possible
- [ ] Unnecessary props, connect's
- [ ] Make sure console logs are removed
- [ ] Make code as tight and concise as possible. E.g. remove `&#123;` from arrow functions if not needed
- [ ] All API requests (http.get, http-post, etc) should be typed
- [ ] Everything should be typed as much as possible; prefer `unknown` over `any` if unable to type
- [ ] When re-using 'reference code, go through it with a fine tooth comb and make sure nothing unnecessary is left in
- [ ] Enums should be in TitleCase and singular
- [ ] Naming intuitive?
- [ ] Prune unused code
- [ ] name files consistent with their main export function / object
- [ ] Remove dead code
- [ ] Order imports sensibly / consistently, use prettier if possible
- [ ] Type can be better than interface, prefer it if applicable
- [ ] Don't export anything unused outside the module
- [ ] Prefer full function syntax (e.g. () => &#123; ... &#125;) to allow for easy insertion of hooks, etc later on with minimal diff
- [ ] Move long strings to a variable
- [ ] Consider removing unnecessary else branch on if
- [ ] Extract copy texts to named constant
- [ ] Avoid defaulting parameters to {} if they might be empty; this just complicates empty-checking, forcing us to empty-check individual fields
- [ ] extract complex filtering logic to semantically / domain specific named functions
- [ ] prefer longer more specific naming, to prevent name clashes
- [ ] "Chunking" over nesting
- [ ] Good use case for DRY: Better to have all the difficult code confined to one place


## Comments

- [ ] Include "director" commentary, including documenting flaws that need to be fixed later
- [ ] Comment constants
- [ ] Advanced features that reader is unlikely to know
- [ ] Warnings
- [ ] Shorter, more precise sentences
- [ ] Communicate intent
- [ ] Use information-dense words, e.g. refer to name of software pattern rather than describing the pattern all over again


## React

- [ ] Use ComponentPropsWithRef&lt;...&gt; or similar to avoid repeatedly defining className and children in props
- [ ] Alias generic return field names (e.g. `data` from hook) to something meaningful (e.g, `cart`) so it's easier to find in text search
- [ ] Hooks should maybe alias generic field names (e.g. `data`) on returning rather than callers doing
- [ ] When there is repeated component consumption, see if you can extract what's common to another component
- [ ] Careful about initialising return value of array to [] in hook without providing some kind of `isLoading` or similar; [] might mean it's still loading and shouldn't be treated as empty list
- [ ] Group related state fields into one state object
- [ ] Avoid contradictions in state
- [ ] Avoid redundant state - use calculation, memoized if necessary
- [ ] Avoid duplication in state
- [ ] Avoid too deeply nested state
- [ ] Don't mirror props in state
- [ ] Consider which component information should be controlled (via props), and which information should be uncontrolled (via state).
- [ ] Generally consider what could trigger re-renders and avoid it, e.g. by extracting to separate child component
- [ ] When encapsulating via hooks, careful about state changes unexpectedly causing component re-renders, slowing down the app
- [ ] Better not to pass spread props into a component generally; this makes it easier to wrap in React.memo where applicable
- [ ] Better to pass primitives rather than objects/arrays/etc in props
- [ ] When rendering dynamic array of components, pass `key` and make sure it's suitable, i.e. not just `index` if items might change order  or if item in same position might be swapped and need to re-render
- [ ] New code: Prefer customer hooks, avoid HOCs and renderProps
- [ ] When using Context Provider anywhere lower than the top level, be careful of the container updating causing context consumers to re-render ; use useMemo and useCallback to memoize the value passed to the provider
- [ ] Catch errors, if possible/likely, in event handlers, callbacks and anywhere else outside React render lifecyce
- [ ] Use ErrorBoundary for errors within React render lifecycle

- [ ] 7.x. Minimise Largest Contentful Paint
- [ ] 7.x. Minimise First Input Delay
- [ ] 7.x. Cumulative Layout shift
- [ ] 7.x. Consistent casing, e.g. "Title case" for titles

- [ ] 7.x. Loading states should not break anything
- [ ] 7.x. Always represent the user's input even if invalid; show validation alongside invalid value
- [ ] 7.x. Modals should capture focus but also be easily closable with focusable Close button
- [ ] 7.x. 
- [ ] 7.x. 


## 8. Manual testing

- [ ] 8.1. Required fields should not accept blank spaces
- [ ] 8.2. Test fields with extreme values, e.g. very low or high numbers or very long strings
- [ ] 8.3. Performing actions more quickly should not cause breakage


## 9. Unit testing

- [ ] Keep tests small as possible, ideally one line! Use helpers and string encoding
- [ ] 9.1. When mocking APIs, assert that they were called with correct path, query string parameters, etc
- [ ] 9.2. Simplify / reduce big cumbersome asserts; e.g. assert on specific field values rather than deeply nested objectContaining
- [ ] 9.3. Use waitForNextUpdate when testing hooks rather than wrapping in waitFor
- [ ] 9.4. Put common behaviour (e.g. rendering) in a beforeEach block rather than repetitively in each it/test block
- [ ] 9.5. All likely execution paths should be covered by tests
- [ ] 9.6. Only use waitFor (not act) and explicitly wait for a side-effect (some text to appear, callback to be called, etc). [jest]
- [ ] 9.7. Don't use free-standing wait, wrap the code in wait block [jest]
- [ ] 9.8. Check for async causing unit test breakage to not get picked up by test [jest]
- [ ] 9.9. Use helpers: makeAxiosError, mockRoles [jest]
- [ ] 9.10. Unit tests should check counterfactual where applicable / useful. E.g. check for element not in document, as well as in document
- [ ] 9.11. Await findBy*; only use waitFor around specific events [jest]
- [ ] 9.12. Prefer userEvent then fireEvent [jest]
- [ ] 9.13. Don't use jest.mock, use jest.spyOn instead [jest]
- [ ] 9.14. Get rid of `let`  in tests [jest]
- [ ] 9.15. Re-use mock data
- [ ] 9.16. Mock data should be copied directly from source if possible, not "cleaned" (as that would make it not representative)
- [ ] Clean and simple mock data as possible, short readable values
- [ ] Centralise commonly used mocks in a shared mocks file
- [ ] Tests should go in appropriate folder and/or have appropriate filename
- [ ] Split unit tests by 'workflow'
- [ ] Unit tests - use toBe(true) if the expected value is actually true and not just truthy
- [ ] Avoid Testld where possible, prefer to query by title, label, aria role etc
- [ ] Where Testlds are needed, try to keep them in a _tests_/ tests.ts
- [ ] Keep component or folder-specific mocks in a _fixtures_/mocks. ts file
- [ ] Prefer userEvent over fireEvent - higher level of abstraction
- [ ] Keep state as local as possible
- [ ] Derive values where possible, avoid useEffect
- [ ] Nice error messages on test failure
- [ ] 




## 10. Querying / caching

- [ ] Use mutate if you don't need a promise, or handle errors if you use mutatesync
- [ ] Use mutate if you don't need a promise, or handle errors if you use mutateAsync
- [ ] Use QueryObserverOptions for options pass-through
- [ ] Make sure useQuery has all required query keys to cache bust correctly
- [ ] Do you really need to useQuery? Will memo do instead?
- [ ] Centralise query keys in packages/backoffice-ui-app-business/src/queries/queryKeys.ts
- [ ] Use select in useQuery rather than transforming inside the fn passed to useQuery
- [ ] Use extractQueryData if applicable
- [ ] Match useQuery signature where possible
- [ ] onSuccessAction should always return an action; for anything else use on Success without returning a value
- [ ] ony cache minimum necessary data points in localstorage or memory, no more than necessary
- [ ] Select session storage vs local storage correctly depending on the use case


## Security

- [ ] Never put potentially sensitive data (e.g. customer details) in uri, localStorage or anywhere it might get inadvertently leaked
- [ ] 


## Bug prevention

- [ ] If something is added to a common type or enum, be careful that there isn't any code that dynamically loops over that thing, which gets inadvertently impacted
- [ ] Careful about using a hook in a context where its data would not be available or otherwise it wouldn't work
- [ ] Check all paths that can lead to a particular component running, not just the path that you're working on
- [ ] Test companies changes in kyb portal
- [ ] Regression-test everything after actioning PR feedback, in case the actioning of the feedback itself contained a bug
- [ ] Impact analysis! Understand all the behaviour that is impacted by the FE change and test it also before pushing the PR
- [ ] Compare behaviour and visible information when running PR branch to current app in CODES. Make sure there isn't inadvertent hiding or distortion of information, bugs, etc. Case in point: # Message from Maciej Pawtowski in #p-business-onboarding
- [ ] Avoid throwing exceptions, as that can cause the whole app to break - instead, gracefully handle it.
- [ ] Did you go manually exercise every piece of code that is affected by your change? (I.e. by clicking/typing in the local running app)
- [ ] Check parameters and early-return / throw error if missing (depending on general guidelines)
- [ ] Make use of `?.` if the goal is to prevent breakage
- [ ] Null check / optionally-chain all properties of a param object that are required, not just the param object itself
- [ ] handle non-numeric values in numeric calculations if necessary


## Performance and efficiency 

- [ ] 14.1. Check for unnecessary change detection (Angular) or render cycles (React) using Chrome Performance Tools or similar 
	- [ ] Can use ngZone.runOutsideAngular to prevent change detection in Angular
- [ ] 14.2. Identify expensive algorithms and optimise them or memoize/cache them
- [ ] 14.3. Use `.reduce` efficiently; don't return result but set accumulator and return it (return by reference)
- [ ] 14.4. Cache/memoize computations that aggregate many pieces of data into one structure (?)
- [ ] Combine useMemo contents where applicable
- [ ] Wrap whole component in memo where applicable
- [ ] 14.5. Avoid "waterfall" requests - chains of dependent requests that slow down rate of rendering
- [ ] Try to make `import` path as specific as possible, e.g. `import Link from "next/link"` rather than `import { Link } from "next"`
- [ ] Keep components small
- [ ] Use path imports rather than destructuring (unless you have tree shaking)
- [ ] 


## Modals

- [ ] 15.1. Avoid consuming context (except theme) inside a modal - it'll be unavailable; pass value to the modal via props instead.
- [ ] 


## API calls

- [ ] 16.1. If api call is being added, ensure it was actually tested and verified to work
- [ ] 16.2. Encode url params if there's any chance that they might contain encodeable characters, e.g. / in uuid; see
- [ ] 16.3. Always ensure that all BE APIs required for the FE change to work are already live and tested
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data isn't being sent when non-HTTPS request is made
- [ ] 

## Design system

- [ ] 17.1. Use VStack / HStack instead of Flex
- [ ] 17.2. Use @revolut/ui-kit components rather than backoffice-ui-components
- [ ] 17.3. Use textChain instead of chain where possible
- [ ] 17.4. In Ul Kit Table column object, Header can just be string


## Software design / code structure

- [ ] Whenever calling a function, see if there's a more specific function that does exactly what you want, to avoid re-implementing something that was already implemented
- [ ] Re-use code in a higher-level folder where possible
- [ ] 18.1. Don't add specific things to generic components
- [ ] 18.2. Naming - make sure names don't go out of date in future
- [ ] 18.3. Split large files into smaller more focused files
- [ ] 18.4. Can something common be extracted to a common module?
- [ ] 18.5. Can something specific be moved to a more specific module?
- [ ] 18.6. Extract pure functions where possible
- [ ] 18.7. When hooks include JSX structures, extract them to components
- [ ] 18.8. Pay attention to which components load which data; should data be loaded by components higher up in the hierarchy and merely passed down to lower components?
- [ ] 18.9. Pull hooks or components up one or more folder levels if they will be used outside of their current folder
- [ ] 18.10. Look at adjacent, similarly named constructs and think about what should be done with them, to avoid confusion
- [ ] Split hooks / functions / components when they start to get too big


## Naming

- [ ] Choosing specific words
- [ ] Avoiding generic names (or knowing when to use them)
- [ ] Using concrete names instead of abstract names
- [ ] Attaching extra information to a name, by using a suffix or prefix
	- [ ] Units
	- [ ] Other important information, e.g. `plaintextPassword`
- [ ] Deciding how long a name should be
- [ ] Using name formatting to pack extra information - e.g. local members prefixed with `_`
- [ ] Prefer min/maxfor inclusive limits, first/last for inclusive ranges
- [ ] is, has, can, or should can make booleans more clear
- [ ] Match expectations of users, e.g. don't name expensive calculation like a simple "getter" 
- [ ] Java - avoid get for non-getters
