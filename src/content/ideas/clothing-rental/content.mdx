## Clothing rental

Many of us have items of clothing that we only use periodically and otherwise don't need.

For example, many men need a suit for more formal occasions such as weddings, parties, funerals and job interviews. But these occasions might only happen a few times a year.

These items may be bulky, take up wardrobe space, be expensive to replace/buy and not durable. They're an particular hassle for minimalists and backpackers, who want to keep a very light footprint and not carry all this expensive bulky clothing with them on every trip, but stil need it to be avaialble, sometimes at short notice (e.g. attending a wedding overseas or interstate).

Wouldn't it be nice if clothing items (of appropriate size) could just be rented at short notice?

Similar to home rentals (AirBnB) and car rentals (Uber Carshare), there should be a clothing rental service, with pick-up and drop-off (e.g. lockers) or delivery options, in every major urban center.

> Aside: Update: It looks like this idea mightn't be so crazy after all. Two examples to date, which I was recently kindly reminded of: [HireTheRunway](https://www.hiretherunway.com.au) and [AirRobe](https://www.airrobe.com).
