It's said that our earliest childhood experiences are formative and shape our tastes and what appeals to us later in life. Music would have to feature big among such early influences. For me, the proverbial roulette ball seems to land on the somewhat prominent (but by no means superstar) Anton Bruckner, the 19th century Austrian symphonist.

I find that my experiences with Anton Bruckner's music relate and connect with musics as seemingly-distant from Brucner as John Cage (silence), John Adams (repetition), Brazilian Candomblé (bodily, religious, ecstatic), Lili Boulanger (silence, hushed tones, meditative symbolism), Olivier Messiaen (organ idioms, repetition, spacious melodies, transformations), Charles Ives (juxtaposition, unity), Samuel Barber (hushed, meditative passages).

## Lightning

The lightening effect, decribed by x, seems to refer to a state of consciousness brought about by Bruckner's music, that is somewhat akin to being "struck by lightening" or having a "lightbulb moment".

This state I describe in my own terms as a kind of sudden, overwhelming rush of energy, joy, ecstasy, total aliveness and awareness (without the aid of psychotropics, I might add).

The effect seems to be related to the structure of the music as a whole and the way that structure becomes visible to the listener over time and especially after repeated listenings.

Similar to how actual lightning seems to temporarily light up the entire sky and seems to engulf it in branching, tree-like structures of light, these sudden outburts heard in Bruckner's music, far from being random or arbitrary, seem to reveal crucial structures that hold up the whole movement or even the whole symphony.

Importantly, these structures are revealed within a **single** musical "gesture", and in doing so, bring the listener into an ecstatic, joyful state of mind.

In their sudden intensity, they give the illusion of being impromptu, but that very suddenness also serves to "shake up" the listener, awakening them to the wonder of the music, of the universe, maybe of life itself?

Perhaps this use of surprise bears some similarity to use of the gong in Buddhist meditation practices (as communicated by figures such as Alan Watts), to awaken the consciousness and focus it on the moment.

As these outbursts are grounded within processes that seem to have already been set in motion, one also can sense a feeling of being "outside of time" while simultaneously being "grounded" in the underlying structures of the music.

Some of my favourite examples of this effect:

Bruckner Symphony 8

Bruckner Symphony 6

## Unity

> “They want me to write in a different way. I could, but I must not.”
> – Anton BRUCKNER

Certain passages seem to hold a kind of inner unity and wholeness – a unity that seems to have somehow already existed outside the symphony. This unity is felt especially strongly at the beginning of great inner passages within the movements and at the codas of the finales.

Often multiple themes are introduced together at the same time and then transformed together in a continuous and intensifying progression. This occurs in an especially touching way in the Adagio of the 2nd Symphony (the 1872 edition in all its unabridged glory) – I find myself fighting back tears every time I hear it. Someone once described it to me as “epiphanic”; I can't think of a better word. It's amazing how well music can convey emotions that the English language struggles with.

Elsewhere, the themes are introduced (or reprised) one after another, sequentially, often with a supporting peddle point. This happens in a particularly awe inspiring way at end of the 8th Symphony, where all the major themes of the Symphony are reprised, both sequentially *and* in combination, all the while grounded in C major, and leading heavenwards. In Celibidache's rendition, with its steady pacing and practically obsessive balancing of instrumentation, one gets an impression of Buddhist chanting.

Bruckner Symphony no. 2, Adagio

I sense a similar kind of unity in the mysterious, repetitive theme in Boulanger's *Praier bouddhique*, Barber's *Adagio for strings* and Ives' reprisal and remixture of themes at the end of his *Symphony 2*.

## Breath

> “Man is the measure of all things”
> – Protagoras of Abdera

> “A silence in Bruckner is called in German an *Atempause*; a pause to take in breath.”
> – Neville CARDUS

When listening intently to Bruckner's music, I've often found myself breathing deeply, in time with the music. This isn't conscious – I only noticed it after the fact. But it seems to be encouraged by certain rhythms within the music itself, which seem to be of the same proportions as the most common, daily human rhythms, such as footsteps, heartbeats and... most importantly... the breath.

Here I connect Bruckner to mindfulness practice – the drawing of attention to bodily sensations and the breath as a pathway to calm serenity and even enlightenment. The steady tension and release of the breath, increasing and decreasing in levels of intensity, but always there, always with us, always warm, glowing and thriving. This evanescent embrace and constant ebb and flow seems to pair well with Bruckner's music, with its steady crescendoes and diminuendos and its broad harmonic arcs.

Another composer I also find myself breathing with – Olivier Messiaen – seems to write in a not dissimilar way. 

## Silence

> “Whenever I want to say something significant, it is necessary to first create a silence.”
> – Anton BRUCKNER

> “‘Sound design’ doesn’t just mean simply decorating with sounds. The creation of non-sound, in other words silence, as in a design, if possible, would be wonderful.”
> – Hiroshi YOSHIMURA

Bruckner's music frequently offers what I can best decribe as a "pregnant pause". A whole-orchestra rest, so well placed and meaningful that it is simultaneously an absence *and* a presence, and in fact, a kind of musical gesture unto itself.

One of my favourite such pauses occurs in Bruckner's 9th Symphony. A crescendo in which we hear a prefiguring of music that will appear later in the Symphony is abruptly halted, almost as if to say "not yet!". What follows (and what the pause perfectly prepares us for) is a most achingly sad (or loving?) passage of spiritual longing, which nonetheless leads us (convincingly) to a recapitulation of the terrifying main theme of the movement. The pause is as integral to the continuity as the music itself.

I find pauses of a similar quality in Lili Boulanger's Vieille Prière Bouddhique. At 5 and between 5 and 7, the music reaches some kind of solemn impasse, and pauses to reflect on itself. And, of course, in the middle of 7, following a trance-like melding of melodies, a dramatic pause leads directly to the great climax of the whole work.

## Salvation

> “Mahler spent his life searching for God, and Bruckner found God”
> – Bruno WALTER

> “Treat every moment as your last. It is not preparation for something else.”
> ― Shunryu SUZUKI

The feeling of "finding", "discovering", being "saved" or being "satisfied" seems to occur frequently across Bruckner's work.

When he sets the music to words – as in the the Te Deum's supplication: "O Lord, in thee have I trusted, let me never be confounded", repeated fervently over minor chords – the overall mood is not one of *expectation*, but rather, of *presence*, *immanence* and *devotion*.

When the music reaches its finale – a song of praise in brilliant C major chords over full orchestra – the choir shouts: "let me never be confounded" over and over, in a kind of joyful, ritualistic ecstasy. This is Bruckner in essence – the celebration of hope itself!

Here, again, I feel a connection to the mindfulness practice of gratitude and the Buddhist overcoming of the "wanting mind" and the letting go of all desire and expectation. Every great moment in Bruckner's work feels complete in itself. It has "already arrived". It doesn't "reach" for a higher or greater moment, though that greatness does inevitably arrive. In this rather Buddhist way it seems to release itself from the "tyranny of expectations".

## Transformation

> “All his apotheotical finals, the hope for another world, the hope of being saved, of being again baptised in light, it exists nowhere else…”
> – Sergiu CELIBIDACHE

Especially in his later works, Bruckner seems to have moved beyond cyclism and toward a kind of transformation and transcendence. Where the 4th Symphony ends in an endless, infinite ecstasy, the 7th and 8th seem to carry us ever skyward, and the uncompleted 9th seems to hint at a kind of "life after life".

Transformation isn't the same thing as "moving on" or even "escaping". Rather, it is an embracing of the present and a use of the past to build a greater future. The past cannot recur or be revisited. It can only create the conditions for the future, which is built in its image.

In the ending of the 8th, all the major themes of the symphony appear in a new light.    in a glorious procession. In a magnified form, transformed into the triumphant key of C major, and underpinned by hypnotic and fanatical string figures and
